## **Parking lot USB exercise**

---

| Contents | The USB drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files, including family and pet photos, a new hire letter, and an employee shift schedule. This suggests that the device holds personally identifiable information (PII) as well as sensitive work documents. Storing personal files with work files is not safe, as it increases the risk of exposure for both types of data. It's crucial to separate personal and work-related files to mitigate the risk of exposure. |

| **Attacker mindset** | An attacker could use the information on the USB drive against Jorge or the hospital. For instance, they could exploit the PII to impersonate Jorge or target other employees through social engineering. The work-related files could provide insight into the hospitalâ€™s operations, potentially allowing unauthorized access to its systems. This could compromise the security of the hospital and its data. |
| **Risk analysis** | USB baiting attacks, capable of concealing various types of malicious software, require a multi-layered approach to security. If an infected device were to infiltrate the hospital's network, it could lead to a data breach or system compromise. This could result in the misuse of sensitive information, such as employee data, hospital schedules, or internal procedures, for launching further attacks on the organization. To address this complex issue, it's crucial to implement technical controls like USB port blocking, operational controls like employee training on safe USB practices, and managerial controls like establishing policies for handling found USB drives. |
