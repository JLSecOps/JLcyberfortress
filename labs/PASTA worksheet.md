| Stages | Sneaker company |
| :---- | :---- |
| **I. Define business and security objectives** | Make **2-3 notes** of specific business requirements to be analyzed. *The sneaker app is intended to connect buyers and sellers of sneakers seamlessly. The app must allow easy sign-ups, log-ins, and account management with secure data privacy. Proper payment handling is essential to avoid legal issues, providing multiple payment options.* |
| **II. Define the technical scope** | List of technologies used by the application: *Application programming interface (API) Public key infrastructure (PKI) SHA-256 SQL Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)* Write **2-3 sentences** (40-60 words) that describe why you choose to prioritize that technology over the others. I would prioritize the API because it is often the primary interface for interacting with external systems and can expose sensitive functions. If not secured, attackers frequently exploit APIs, especially in mobile applications. APIs often handle large volumes of user data, including authentication and payment, and are, therefore, critical to assess first for security risks. |
| **III. Decompose application** | [Sample data flow diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ol7y79popTFfNHM-90ES-H-i1Lpd0YNvPShxBlXozjg/template/preview?resourcekey=0-DZAkf7Vzh2PXsP-j3oXV-g) The application allows buyers to search for sneakers using an SQL query that interacts with the database. Additionally, sensitive user data such as passwords and credit card information is hashed using SHA-256 and secured using AES encryption. |
| **IV. Threat analysis** | List **2 types of threats** in the PASTA worksheet that are risks to the information being handled by the application. *External Threat: A potential SQL injection attack targeting the sneaker app’s database through poorly sanitized input fields. Internal Threat: A malicious insider could misuse their access to view or alter sensitive customer data due to weak access control policies.* |
| **V. Vulnerability analysis** | List **2 vulnerabilities** in the PASTA worksheet that could be exploited. *The SQL database could be vulnerable to injection attacks if the user inputs are not sanitized. The encryption keys used for AES encryption could be exposed if the key management process is insecure.* |
| **VI. Attack modeling** | [Sample attack tree diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FmWLyHgmq9XQoVuMxOym2PHO8IuedCkan4moYnI-EJ0/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-zYPY7AhPJdcClXamlAfOag) Attackers could exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities by inputting malicious commands that the server executes, granting unauthorized access to the database. This could lead to data breaches where sensitive customer information is exfiltrated. Additionally, a malicious insider could bypass restrictions and tamper with customer data or financial transactions if weak access controls are present. |
| **VII. Risk analysis and impact** | List **4 security controls** that you’ve learned about that can reduce risk. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add a layer of security beyond just usernames and passwords. Ensure encryption keys are stored securely using hardware security modules (HSMs). Use prepared statements in SQL to mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks. Regularly audit and monitor access logs to promptly detect and respond to suspicious behavior.  |
