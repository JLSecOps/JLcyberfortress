# Security Automation Scripts

## Key Objective
To automate repetitive security tasks such as log analysis, access control management, and vulnerability detection, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## Overview
This directory contains scripts and resources for automating security tasks, including access control updates, log analysis, and threat detection.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python**: For writing automation scripts.
- **Bash**: For command-line log parsing and scripting.
- **SQL**: For detecting injection vulnerabilities in database queries.

## Outcomes
- Automated log analysis to detect failed login attempts.
- Developed scripts to identify and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Reduced manual workload for access control updates.
