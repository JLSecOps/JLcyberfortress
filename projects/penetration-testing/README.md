# Penetration Testing

## Key Objectives
- Conduct ethical hacking to test the resilience of systems against potential attacks.
- Use tools like Metasploit to simulate exploitation scenarios.
- Provide a comprehensive report with actionable remediation strategies.

## Overview
This project focuses on simulating real-world cyberattacks to identify weaknesses in system defenses. The penetration testing exercises include network scanning, vulnerability exploitation, and reporting.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Metasploit**: Simulated vulnerability exploitation.
- **nmap**: Performed network reconnaissance to identify open ports and services.
- **Burp Suite**: Tested web applications for security flaws.

## Outcomes
- Detected SQL injection vulnerabilities in application logs.
- Documented a phishing incident response workflow.
- Developed actionable threat models to mitigate potential risks.

## Files Included
- **SQL Injection Detection Documentation**  
  - Analysis and detection techniques for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
