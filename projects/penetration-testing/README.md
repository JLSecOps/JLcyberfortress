# Penetration Testing

## Overview
This project focuses on simulating real-world cyberattacks to identify weaknesses in system defenses. The penetration testing exercises include network scanning, vulnerability exploitation, and reporting.

## Key Objectives
- Conduct ethical hacking to test the resilience of systems against potential attacks.
- Use tools like Metasploit to simulate exploitation scenarios.
- Provide a comprehensive report with actionable remediation strategies.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Metasploit**: Simulated vulnerability exploitation.
- **nmap**: Performed network reconnaissance to identify open ports and services.
- **Burp Suite**: Tested web applications for security flaws.

## Outcomes
- Discovered critical vulnerabilities, including unpatched software and weak access controls.
- Recommended multi-factor authentication (MFA) and updated software patches.
- Enhanced organizational awareness of penetration testing benefits.
