### **Operational environment:**

The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's dataâ€”100 on-premise and 20 remote employees. The bank's customer base includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. Strict financial regulations require the bank to secure its data and funds, such as having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

**Asset:** The asset at risk of being harmed, damaged, or stolen.  
**Risk(s):** A potential risk to the organization's information systems and data.  
**Description:** A vulnerability that might lead to a security incident.  
**Likelihood:** Score from 1-3 of the chances of a vulnerability being exploited. A 1 means there's a low likelihood, a 2 means a moderate likelihood, and a 3 means a high likelihood.  
**Severity:** Score from 1-3 of the potential damage the threat would cause to the business. A 1 means a low-severity impact, a 2 is a moderate impact, and a 3 is a high-severity impact.  
**Priority:** How quickly a risk should be addressed to avoid the potential incident. Use the following formula to calculate the overall score: **Likelihood x Impact Severity \= Risk**
