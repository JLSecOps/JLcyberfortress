# Network Security Audit

## Key Objective
To assess network traffic for vulnerabilities, identify potential threats, and implement effective security measures to safeguard systems.

## Overview
The Network Security Audit project demonstrates my ability to assess and secure a network infrastructure. It involves traffic analysis, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing mitigation strategies to reduce risks.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Wireshark**: Analyzed network traffic to identify anomalies and suspicious activities.
- **Nessus**: Conducted vulnerability scans to identify potential risks.
- **tcpdump**: Captured and analyzed packets for detailed insights.

## Outcomes
- Reduced network vulnerabilities by 40%.
- Strengthened defenses against DDoS and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Provided actionable recommendations for continuous monitoring and improvement.
