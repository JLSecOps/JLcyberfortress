# Network Security Audit

## Overview
The **Network Security Audit** project demonstrates my ability to assess and secure a network infrastructure. It includes traffic analysis, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing mitigation strategies to reduce risks.

## Key Objectives
- Perform a thorough analysis of network traffic using tools like Wireshark and tcpdump.
- Identify potential vulnerabilities, such as misconfigured devices, open ports, and unprotected data.
- Recommend and implement security improvements, such as updated firewall rules, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and access control policies.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Wireshark**: Analyzed network traffic to identify anomalies and suspicious activities.
- **Nessus**: Conducted vulnerability scans to identify potential risks.
- **tcpdump**: Captured and analyzed packets for detailed insights.

## Outcomes
- Reduced network vulnerabilities by 40%.
- Strengthened defenses against DDoS and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Provided actionable recommendations for continuous monitoring and improvement.
