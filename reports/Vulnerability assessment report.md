# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **1st November 2024**

# **System Description**

The server hardware has a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the system's current access controls. The assessment will cover three months, from September 2024 to October 2024\. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

The database server is a valuable asset to the business because it stores critical customer information and is regularly queried by employees for business operations. Securing this data is crucial, and it's a responsibility we all share to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. If the server were disabled or compromised, it could lead to data breaches, loss of customer trust, and disruption of business operations.

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Competitor* | *Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attack* | *2* | *3* | *6* |
| *Hacker* | *Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration* | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| *Employer* | *Alter/Delete critical information* | *2* | *2* | *4* |

# **Approach**

The selected threat sources—hacker, competitor, and employee—were chosen due to their potential to cause significant harm to the business. Hackers directly threaten data confidentiality and integrity, especially with the server being publicly accessible. Competitors might use DoS attacks to disrupt operations and gain a market advantage. Whether malicious or accidental, employees can alter or delete crucial information, impacting the business's daily operations. The likelihood and severity scores were determined based on the public nature of the server, the high value of the data it contains, and the potential business impact of each event.

# **Remediation Strategy**

The remediation strategy involves implementing a defense-in-depth approach, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation to protect the database server. A key security measure is enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, which plays a crucial role in preventing unauthorized access. Access controls must be restricted to the principle of least privilege, ensuring employees only access data necessary for their roles. Additionally, regular audits and monitoring of access logs are crucial to promptly detecting and responding to any unauthorized activities or anomalies.
