**Incident report analysis**

| Summary | For two hours, the multimedia company experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that compromised its internal network. The attack involved a flood of ICMP packets that overwhelmed the network, halting normal operations. The incident management team responded by blocking ICMP packets and restoring critical services. The cybersecurity team identified an unconfigured firewall as the vulnerability exploited in the attack. |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | ----- | ----- |
| Identify | Conduct audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges regularly. Identify unconfigured or poorly configured firewalls and other security devices. Assess the network for potential gaps, such as open ports or outdated security measures.  |  |  |
| Protect | Implement firewall rules to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets. Use source IP address verification to check for spoofed IP addresses. Establish comprehensive security policies and procedures for network protection. Provide regular training for staff on cybersecurity best practices and threat awareness.  |  |  |
| Detect | Deploy network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns. Utilize Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to filter out suspicious ICMP traffic. Enhance the speed and efficiency of detection processes through automated alerts and continuous monitoring. |  |  |
| Respond | Develop a response plan to contain and neutralize security incidents quickly. Analyze incidents to identify root causes and implement improvements. Ensure communication and coordination among the incident response team during an event.  |  |  |
| Recover | Restore affected systems to regular operation following an incident. Implement data recovery procedures to restore lost or compromised data. Review and update recovery plans to ensure they remain effective and comprehensive. |  |  |

| Reflections/Notes:  The incident highlighted the importance of properly configured firewalls in preventing DDoS attacks. Continuous monitoring and regular audits are essential in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. Integrating the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides a structured approach to enhancing overall network security.  |
