## Objective
Aspiring cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in incident response, network traffic analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Driven by a commitment to safeguarding data and systems, I want to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst to apply my skills in protecting organizations from evolving cyber threats.

## Projects
### [Network Traffic Analysis (DDoS Attack)](https://github.com/JosephLloyd/network-traffic-analysis)
Conducted a network traffic analysis to identify and mitigate a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using tcpdump and Wireshark. Analyzed ICMP packet floods and implemented firewall rules to prevent future incidents.

### [Phishing Incident Response Playbook](https://github.com/JosephLloyd/phishing-playbook)
Developed a structured response playbook for handling phishing alerts, including detailed steps for evaluating alerts, escalating issues, and documenting findings for continuous improvement.

### [Algorithm for File Updates in Python](https://github.com/JosephLloyd/file-update-automation)
Created a Python-based algorithm to automate the process of updating access control lists by removing restricted IPs from an allowed list. Demonstrated skills in Python scripting and file handling.

### [Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://github.com/JosephLloyd/vulnerability-assessment)
Conducted a vulnerability assessment for a Linux-based server, identified high-risk vulnerabilities, and recommended remediation strategies, including multi-factor authentication and access control updates.

### [Risk Register](https://github.com/JosephLloyd/risk-register)
Developed a risk register to document and prioritize security risks, applying a structured risk assessment matrix to evaluate the likelihood, severity, and priority of each risk.
