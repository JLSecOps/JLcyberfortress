## About Me
Hi! I’m Joseph Lloyd. I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio, and I’m a naturally curious, detail-oriented individual who loves diving into complex challenges. My journey into cybersecurity stems from my innate drive to understand how things work and my desire to protect the systems that power our increasingly digital world.

Before transitioning into cybersecurity, I worked as a Medical Assistant, managing sensitive patient data and ensuring strict adherence to HIPAA compliance standards. This experience taught me the importance of confidentiality, attention to detail, and following established protocols—skills that seamlessly translate into cybersecurity, especially in roles focused on securing sensitive information and maintaining system integrity.

I chose cybersecurity because it allows me to channel my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and love for continuous learning into a career where I can make a real difference. I thrive on protecting digital assets, identifying vulnerabilities, and staying one step ahead of evolving threats.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I’ve worked as a Life Coach, helping others set and achieve their goals. This experience honed my communication and leadership skills, which I bring to collaborative environments like Security Operations Centers (SOC). Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, learning new programming languages, and mentoring others starting their technology journeys.

My ultimate goal is to grow into a cybersecurity leader who defends systems and inspires and empowers teams to work together toward a safer digital future. I bring enthusiasm, integrity, and creativity to everything I do, and I’m excited to continue my professional journey in cybersecurity.
